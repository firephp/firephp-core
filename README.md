FirePHPCore
===========

This project holds the [FirePHP Tool](http://firephp.org) in the form of a PHP server library calld **FirePHPCore** which is compatible with the latest [Firefox Web Extension for FirePHP](https://github.com/firephp/firephp-for-firefox-devtools).

> FirePHP is a logging system that can display PHP variables in a browser as an application is navigated. All communication is out of band to the application which means the logging data will not interfere with the normal functioning of the application.

**INTENDED USE:** The *Logic and Code contained within* forms a **Developer Tool** and is intended to operate as part of a *Web Software Development Toolchain* on which a *Production System* operates indirectly. It is **NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN HIGH-LOAD ENVIRONMENTS** as there is *little focus on Runtime Optimization* in order to *maximize API Utility, Compatibility and Flexibility*.

If you *need more* than what is contained within, study the Code, understand the Logic, and build your *Own Implementation* that is *API Compatible*. Share it with others who follow the same *Logic* and *API Contract* specified within. This Community of Users will likely want to use Your Work in their own *Software Development Toolchains*.
